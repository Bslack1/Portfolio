# Portfolio
## This is a professional portfolio of projects completed during my education.

1 - This SwiftUI project is an application created for my senior seminar / capstone project. The app is meant to be a discrete aid for young 
adults attempting to leave high-control organizations they were born into. It includes international crisis support, therapist approved articles
about building healthy relationships and information on connecting with those who have also left. This is a work in progress, the bulk of the 
content comes from other content creators, the content is in the process of being added. There is a locationcode/pin code being aded that locks 
the actual content. This app will be completed and taken live upon completion. 

2 - This is a collection of code, descriptive statistics and the completed published research for my Summer Research Undergratuate Experience. 
I developed my own research methodology scrapping data from Twitter (Reddit was also considered), to attempt to assess the impact of moratoriums 
ending on the public opinion of utility companies across the United States post pandemic lockdown. The research was published in a peer reviewed 
article. This was done using R, NVIVO, and SPSS. The data collected was used to conduct a sentiment analysis. 

3 - C language coursework from CS 101. 

4 - C++ language coursefok from CS 102.

5 - LaTeX projects from elective course.

6 - Statistics presentations from various elective statistics classes.

More is to follow, as I compile the multiple projects that are scattered on mulitple machines. 

Thank you for reading!
